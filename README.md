# Pokedex
A Pokedex implementation by various contributors.

Welcome to our Pokedex. We collaborate on this fun project to build one of the best Pokedexes in the world. It's Open Source and it's free! We at Refocus give this task to our prospective team-mates. This Pokedex needs to be built from scratch without using any frameworks or tools! Pure HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Let's see what greatness awaits, looking forward to seeing you contribute some great code and help you learn quite a bit through these tasks.



## TODO:
1) A UI that is similar to the cartoon version of pokedex. This needs to be built entirely with CSS, so make sure you're handy with CSS before attempting this. You should be good with layouts, positioning and creating shapes out of CSS. You can add interactivity by plugging in event listeners to your HTML with plain JavaScript. 

2) Parse the Data from js/pokedex.json and display the below listed fields on the Pokedex.
// Replace the 'XXX' in <https://assets.pokemon.com/assets/cms2/img/pokedex/full/XXX.png> with the pokemon ID to request an image of the pokemon, instead of using the img in the json file(has better quality pictures!).
